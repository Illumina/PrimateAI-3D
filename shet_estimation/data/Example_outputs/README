These output files are partial ouputs from simulation scripts.

Each row of output files from simulation_SFS_neutral.py or simulation_SFS_neutral_splitting5populations.py contains the following columns, delimited by space:

The 1st column shows the value of T1.
The 2nd column shows the value of Nefactor.
The 3rd column shows the value of popratio.
The 4th column indicates snptype.
The 5th column indicates the index of output samples sampled from the simulated final population at present day.
The 6th column indicates the index of locus among the 100,000 independent loci where a variant occurs.
The 7th column indicates the allele count of the variant at the locus.

Each row of output files from simulation_SFS_with_selection.py contains the following columns, delimited by space:

The 1st column shows the value of selection coefficient.
The 2nd column indicates snptype.
The 3rd column indicates the index of output samples sampled from the simulated final population at present day.
The 4th column indicates the index of locus among the 100,000 independent loci where a variant occurs.
The 5th column indicates the allele count of the variant at the locus.
The 6th column indicates the generation when the variant occurs.
